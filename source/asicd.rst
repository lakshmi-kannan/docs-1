Welcome to FlexSwitch ASICd's documentation!
============================================
.. image:: images/Asic_daemon.jpg

Overview
--------
Snaproute's asic daemon serves as a hardware abstraction layer (HAL). A common northbound API interface is presented to all protocol daemons.
This interface allows provisioning a range of packet processing ASICs. Support for software simulation with docker instances is also provided.

Software Architecture
---------------------

Northbound interface :
----------------------
ASICd's northbound interface is implemented using thrift RPC. This is the interface that is used by users/protocols to apply configuration.

Core resource managers :
------------------------
The core infrastructure within Asicd is distributed across multiple resource managers. Each of these individual resource managers support Create/Retrieve/Update and Delete operations on the corresponding resource.
These resource managers also maintain any relevant state data for each corresponding resource.

Plugins :
---------
ASICd uses a plugin based approach to effectively abstract away differences between ASICs. The following plugins are currently supported

OpenNsl 

SAI 

Softswitch 

Notifications :
---------------
ASICd supports notification of asynchronous events. The notification engine employs a nano message based publisher.

Notifications for the following events are currently supported -

Port operational state changes

Vlan/Lag interface creation/deletion

IP interface operational state changes
